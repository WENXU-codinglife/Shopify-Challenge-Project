# Simple Showcase

This is a personal project inspired by Shopify intern challenge question.<br>
Simple Showcase is an e-commerce-like web app helping users manage and demonstrate products/images. Users can sign up an account and log in, then add new products by providing product information and uploading a number of images. The images can be labeled as 'private' so that they will be privately visible, otherwise, demonstrated publicly. <br>

<!-- Simple Showcase is also deployed onto Heroku, click [here](https://shopify-challenge-proj.herokuapp.com/) to visit. -->

## Getting Started

<!-- These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. -->

### Prerequisites

To run the app, first please install the dependancies:

```
pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-login
```

### Installing

<!-- A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo -->

Clone this repo and enter the directory.
Then configure and run it:<br>

```
export FLASK_APP=project
```

The <span style="background-color:grey">FLASK_APP</span> environment variable instructs Flask how to load the app.

```
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
```

The <span style="background-color:grey">FLASK_DEBUG</span> environment variable is enabled by setting it to 1.

```
flask run
```

Flask will monitor changes to app files and reload the server when thereâ€™s a change. No bothering to turn it off and on for each single change.
